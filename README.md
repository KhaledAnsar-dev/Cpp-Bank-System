# 🧾 Cpp-Bank-System

### 📌 Overview
This is one of my earliest Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects, built entirely in C++ as a console-based banking system. It was developed approximately two years ago as part of my foundational learning in software development.

At the time, I focused on understanding key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and composition. The project simulates a basic banking management system using plain text files for data storage.

### 🧠 Key Features
- User login with permissions.
- CRUD operations for bank clients.
- Deposit, withdraw, and balance transfer functionality.
- Transaction logging and user login tracking.
- Basic currency exchange module.
- File-based data persistence (no database used).

### 🧰 Technologies Used
- C++ (Console Application)
- File I/O (Text-based persistence)
- OOP principles (classes, inheritance, enums)
- STL (Vectors, Strings)

### 🔖 Note
This project was originally developed around 2023 and is being uploaded now in 2025 for archiving and portfolio purposes. No updates have been applied to the original implementation — it reflects my coding style and understanding at that stage of my journey.
